# fizzbuzz
A solution for the fizzbuzz programming challenge

By Blockyboy

What is fizzbuzz?

Fizzbuzz is a program which displays numbers 1 to 1000. When a number is a multiple of 3, then the program replaces the number with 'fizz'. 
When a number is a multiple of 5, the same is done with 'buzz'. When the number has both cases, then the result is 'fizzbuzz'

This project is mainly a challenge for myself. I have made it customisable within the code, allowing users to play with changing the words displayed 
and the amount of numbers displayed.
